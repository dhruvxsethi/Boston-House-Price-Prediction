# Boston-House-Price-Prediction
ML Project Using Linear Regression - Predict Prices of Houses in Boston

Implemented Linear Regression Model on the Boston Housing Dataset. 
Steps performed to build the model in order to predict the prices of houses -

1. Imported the Boston dataset from the sklearn dataset repository.
2. Printed the value of the Boston dataset to understand what it contains.
3. Created a correlation matrix that gives the correlation coeffecients of the features.
4. Applied the linear regression model to predict the house prices, and displayed the accuracy of this model.
